azure-mobile-services-for-unity3d
=================================

A suite of Azure Mobile Services plugins for Unity3D, cross platform with common interfaces, with examples.

The goal is simple.  "Just hit build".  That means 1 API, no platform dependent code.  The plugin should hide platform intracacies, not surface them.

Runs across:
- UnityEditor - Lightweight support in Unity so you don't need to build to test your app.  No more stubbing data locally.
- Windows 8 Store - Uses the underlying native DLL for consistent and robust integration
- Windows Phone 8 - Uses the underlying native DLL for consistent and robust integration

Coming soon:
- iOS
- Android

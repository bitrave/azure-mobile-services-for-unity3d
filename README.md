azure-mobile-services-for-unity3d
=================================

A suite of Azure Mobile Services plugins for Unity3D, cross platform with common interfaces, with examples.

The goal is simple.  "Just hit build".  That means 1 API, no platform dependent code.  The plugin should hide platform intracacies, not surface them.

We have replaced the old versions (AzureMobileServicesPlugin/AzureMobileServicesUnityProject) with a single version AzureMobileServicesUniversal.  This version runs on everything, has asynchronous calls for everything, and while a little more verbose, gives you a lot more power, such as authentication.

Runs across:
- UnityEditor 
- Windows 8 Store 
- Windows Phone 8 
- iOS
- Android
- Probably everything else Unity runs on

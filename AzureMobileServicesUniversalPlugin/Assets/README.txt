1. This project relies on JsonDotNet for Unity, you can get it on the Unity asset store.  It costs $20.  It's worth it, just get it.  JSON libraries for each platform are different to having a ubiquitous library that works on all platforms.  

2. Drag the AzureUI onto a camera, it tends to not attach from source control.  Hit run.

3. Head to Facebook and get your access tokens for your service (the demo uses facebook, hack the code to use something else).  Facebook tokens can be easily grabbed for dev's from https://developers.facebook.com/tools/accesstoken/

4. Enjoy, and if you have issues, let me know.  It's different to the old version, everything is Async, but it's better, more robust, and handles authentication.

5. And the best bit.  Just hit build.  You don't need to do anything 'tricky' for each platform any more.
